The media is often presenting scenarios of the future where AI is taken over and becomes an enemy of human society. The use of AI can of course harbor danger in the sense of misuse, discrimination, loss of transparency and other reasons, but the picture that is often drawn about machines that act independently and are out of control, is misleading in many facets. 

With the current status quo of machine learning technology, we have to face a lot of other challenges. These are e.g. a thorough discussion about fairness criteria, ethics, how to decide about the use of new technologies, which values we should weight in order to decide what is good for society or what is a burden. 

This text is a collection of  ideas and already projects in-use that have the intention to build a more sustainable future. 



## Why we need better standards and rules for machine learning

While a much deeper discussion why we need ethics in machine learning is provided in Barocas', Hardt's & Narayanan's book which is freely available, one of the best examples in my opinion that mirrors social unfairness is the use of algorithms in order to make decisions about credit scoring. The algorithm puts more weight on criteria that were a good indicator in the past for whether the loan applicant will default or not (Barocas, Hardt & Narayanan, 2019). While this weighting of giving credit to a rich person while probably not giving credit to a person that has difficulties to pay the credit back can be highly discussed already standing by itself, using algorithms for this task can even worsen the gap between rich and poor, or ethical groups in society. Algorithms are decoupled with us humans and not knowing about the biases of the data that is used for the training of an algorithm, makes us blind to unfairness and gives us the illusion of taking an objective decision, free from human injustice. 

We fully ignore social inequalities and discrimination when we blindly use algorithms that make use of historical data. This historical data often predicts success for an already socially advantaged group and predicts failure to an disadvantaged group. 

This is only an example of many. 

Hearing about algorithms that are used for deciding about the risk of a person to re-offend after leaving prison (COMPAS algorithm), that give a higher risk score to people only because they are black is another of these popular examples. 

There are many application fields of algorithms that are critical and without a proper debate in society - the use of drones, autonomous driving, advertisement through the collection of data, done by global players like Google.  It is more and more difficult to refuse permission without abstaining from the usage of apps, search machines or collaboration platforms. 



Most of us, in my perspective, have a rather ambivalent relation to all these new applications and technologies that are enabled through machine learning. The possibilities are fascinating and they promise a facilitation of life in many areas. The use of our data, an the other side, is largely mystified and nontransparent. We can not really decide whether we give permissions about our data or whether we use certain applications or not. This is mostly because alternatives are either missing or overseen. 

We need a rethinking of how to decide about a sustainable and socially valuable use of these technologies.

## More democracy and transparency 

A person that has recently attracted my attention is Francesca Bria who was Chief Digital Technology and Innovation Officer of the city of Barcelona and who is also the founder of the 'decode-project' which is a EU wide initiative about data sovereignty.  

Francesca Bria's vision is about giving the people the possibility to actively decide whether or not they want to give their data for research reasons, political reasons or social reasons. People should know how their data is used and when. They should participate in decision processes about developing e.g. smart cities and deciding where reduced traffic-areas should be build and how a sustainable mobility system can be best realized in compatibility with the needs of the citizens. 

There is a short ZEIT interview, published on YouTube, that is also worth watching for gaining a better idea about how this can work: [youtube link: Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MJsnUlEB-M)

## Providing a more sustainable world



An article by Vinuesa et al. (2020) systematically evaluates the role of AI in reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is stressed in the article that AI has the potential to support the goals, e.g. through the provision of food, health, water, and energy services or supporting the creation of circular economies and smart cities. Another positive example mentioned in the article is that 'AI can help to identify areas of poverty and foster international action using satellite images'. 

Specifically for climate change concerns, AI has the potential to help us better understand the processes of climate change and its impacts. It can also support low-carbon energy systems and energy efficiency.

Further the identification of desertification trends over large areas is possible with AI, which can help to avoid further desertification in the future and help to react and plan faster. 

On the other hand, AI technologies have a high energy demand and a high carbon footprint. Often it is not clear if the resources needed for research on how to develop tools for achieving sustainable goals can be compensated afterwards with the beneficial effects. 

Further, AI technologies are usually designed on the needs and values of the nations in which they are developed. If these nations do not have high ethical standards, lack transparency and democratic control, AI usage can increase social inequalities, or nationalism (Vinuesa et al., 2020). This argument, in my opinion, shows the need for global ethical standards in the future if we really want to avoid that not everything what is possible is also developed and used. If a solution for global ethical standards can not be approached, we should at least start locally and show solutions that use high ethical standards. We should include people in decisions about the usage of algorithms and data and show that it is possible to build systems that are fair and social. 

## Some concrete examples

#### Circular economy and smart cities

Sometimes we need energy to cool things down and sometimes we need energy to heat up things. There are some clever ideas to couple systems in order to efficiently use heat that is produced as a waste product. One example for this are organic data centers - data centers that give their heat waste to greenhouses such that less energy has to be produced for the greenhouse system. 

This is described by Karnamaa,  Haghighib and Vinuesac (2019, [link to paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2019.100063):

This is one example of what is also understood within the concept of a **circular economy**. The term circular economy describes a system in which it is tried to recycle and reuse things, as well as trying to reduce energy use in the first place. 

Due to Nerini, Slob, Engström and Trutnevyte (2019), decarbonization of cities can be approached mainly by three concepts: smart cities, circular economy and efficient technologies for heat, electricity and energy. 

The term smart city describes a city that is interconnected through a network that serves to make processes more efficient. There are diverse projects ranging from smart lamp posts or smart bins that can reduce energy, car-sharing initiatives, food sharing communities, local product plans, to so called **smart grids** that try to balance production and consumption in several aspects (energy, food, water supply etc.).

Strategies to find a good trade-off between replacing already existing infrastructure with a completely new one, are still lacking (Nerini et al., 2019). For example, it needs expert knowledge to calculate and weight the benefits of a new infrastructure or a more efficient heat system against the production costs and resources that are needed for the new systems. 



#### Drought prediction

Machine learning techniques can help with the prediction of droughts and therefore have a positive impact through early warning. With the climate change, there will be a high demand for such techniques. A paper by Agana and Homaifar (2017) is for example describing that drought prediction is a highly complex phenomenon and has a random, nonlinear nature. The contribution of a lot of different factors can be modeled by a Deep Belief Network, that can also make long-term predictions.
