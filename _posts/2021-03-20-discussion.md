At the end of our 3-day PhD-workshop, there will be a **discussion** that will be **open to the public**. **Eva Wolfangel** (moderation), **Prof. Andreas Jungherr****, **Dr. Simon Schaupp**, **Dr. Thomas Grote** and **Prof. Ulrike von Luxburg** will first have a 45-min panel discussion about their assessment of the current situation and future developments of AI technologies. 



After that, there will be the opportunity for everyone to engage in discussions, within the scope of a 'World Caf√©'.



Everyone is invited to participate! Places are limited tough. In order to register, please visit this website:
