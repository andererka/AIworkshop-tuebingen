  <u>Keynote talk:</u> "AI and democracy: AI in politics and the politics of AI"

  *As artificial intelligence technology features in ever more aspects of social and economic life, AI becomes political. The use of AI by politicians and states is associated with both hopes and fears. Will AI increase social inequalities and allow politicians to split and manipulate the public? Or will AI allow politicians and states to tackle important problems with better information and new solutions? These fears and hopes find expression in public debate and political contestation. Scholars have an important role in this debate. They are on the frontlines of AI development and its implementation. At the same time, excessive fears or hopes regarding the impact of AI might make for great movie-plots but not so much for good policy advice or ethical guidelines. So, while we need to discuss the potential uses and effects of AI in democracies, we should not be carried away by excessive fears or hopes and thereby accidentally block progress or sow distrust in politics and elections*.
  
- **Prof. Michèle Finck**: Professor of Law and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Tübingen. She focuses on artificial intelligence and the digital economy with a particular emphasis on data (protection) law and governance (See Prof. Finck's homepage for further information: [https://michelefinck.eu/](https://michelefinck.eu/))
