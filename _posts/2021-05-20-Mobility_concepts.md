**Call for Applications:**
International PhD Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning research and
Democracy –an interdisciplinary perspective
29.1 – 31.1.2022 at the University of Tübingen
We invite PhD students from various disciplines (Politics, Law, Philosophy, Sociology, Artificial
Intelligence, Machine Learning) to participate in our interdisciplinary workshop at the University of
Tübingen in January 2022.



**About the workshop:**
As the use of Machine Learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence pervades all areas of
our lives and societies, it also affects fundamental pillars of democracy, such as public
debate, political decision making and (dis)information through media.
In our PhD workshop entitled “Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning research and democracy –
an interdisciplinary perspective” we will provide a platform for young researchers from all relevant
disciplines – from dedicated machine learning research to political science and every nuance in
between – to engage in exchange of methods and current state of the art research. Our guiding
question will be:
How can we shape the co-development of AI/ ML research and democracy?
Workshop structure:
Being aware of the challenges of bringing different disciplines together, we will put a focus on creative
and interactive formats such as Bar Camps and simulation games to facilitate profound discussions
during the workshop. Besides keynote lectures by invited guest speakers, all participants will have
the opportunity to present their ideas on how to shape this co-development.
In a three-step procedure, we will first take an account of the status quo by identifying the perils and
potentials of AI/ML for democracy. Next, we will broaden the scope of the discussion to address
questions of responsibility in research and different stances on technological determinism. In a last
third step, we will get inspired by and develop own visions of the future co-development of AI/ML and
democracy, discuss the (un)desirability of these visions and identify the actions that we as PhD
students in AI/ML, philosophy, politics, and other related disciplines can undertake to realize (or
prevent) them.
The workshop will end with a public panel on the last day which will present the main thoughts and
discuss further steps regarding responsibilities of AI/ML research and democracy. By this we want to
invite you to become part of a new network of young researchers who take responsibility for the future
of AI and democracy.



**How to apply:**
Interested PhD students are welcome to apply with a short abstract (approx. 200 words) presenting
their research and its connection to the workshop’s subjects. Furthermore, we ask for a short personal
motivational letter (app. 100 words) to participate in the workshop.
Please send your application to ilja.mirsky@uni-tuebingen.de until November 19 th 2021.
