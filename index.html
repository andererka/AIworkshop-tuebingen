As the use of Machine Learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence pervades all areas of
our lives and societies, it also affects fundamental pillars of democracy, such as public
debate, political decision making and (dis)information through media. In our PhD workshop
entitled “<i>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning research and democracy – an
interdisciplinary perspective</i>” we will provide a platform for young researchers from all
relevant disciplines – from dedicated machine learning research to political science and
every nuance in between – to engage in exchange of methods and current state of the art
research. Our guiding question will be:

<p>

<b>How can we shape the co-development of AI/ ML research and democracy?</b>
