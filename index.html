After two years of pandemic, the interdisciplinary PhD workshop ›AI and Democracy‹ was supposed to be different: far away from the pixelated faces, the ›trying-to-reconnect‹ remarks, and the anger about the people who—after two years of online-meetings—still haven’t managed to get themselves a decent microphone. While ›growing tired of online-meetings‹ would have been an accurate description of many people’s states of mind during 2021, the predominant mood of 2022 shifted towards a gloomy resignation. For this reason, too, the enchanting German March weather—with what felt like 25 hours of sunshine per day—made the anticipation of the first face-to-face workshop soar for many participants.
