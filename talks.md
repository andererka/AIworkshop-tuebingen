  Trust has become one of the foundational concepts of contemporary social theory. Still,empirical research on trust relies on a relatively small set of measures which are increasingly debated. Using data from an online, self-administered questionnaire which was conducted amongst a US representative sample (N = 1,500) and relying on a combination of open-ended probing data and supervised machine learning, our study compares the validity of standard measures of generalized social trust with more recent, situation-specific measures of trust. We find that measures that refer to strangers generally better reflect the conceptual idea of measuring trust in unknown others. Moreover, situation-specific measures even further reduce variation in associations, i.e., produce a more similar frame of reference which is desirable from a measurement perspective. We also present evidence that individuals’ the association may differ in terms of sentiment, independently of the trustee category. Finally, we end with a discussion of the hard-to-solve challenge of formulating general but not too general survey measures

  <u>Keynote Talk:</u> 'The technopolitics of algorithmic management'

  Algorithms are organizing technologies. Like organizational rules or laws, they  define procedures according to which certain actions are to be executed. Yet, while we commonly identify laws or organizational rules as  political issues, which are negotiated in the context of conflicting  interests, we often fail to see the political nature of algorithms. This lecture aims to develop a political perspective on technologies of  algorithmic management in contexts of work. It reconstructs how  algorithmic management gained the importance it has in today’s world of  work, from wearable devices controlling individual workers to  overarching resource planning systems. The lecture will show how  technopolitical negotiations at various levels have shaped algorithmic  management so that it often resembles the logic of cybernetic management with its emphasis on feedback-based self-organization. Drawing on  ethnographic fieldwork in factories and delivery companies, the lecture  will emphasize that digitalization is not only shaped by engineers and  managers but also by the various appropriation strategies developed by  workers in their everyday use of technology. Thus, the lecture argues  that developing a political perspective on digitalization is a  prerequisite for democratic deliberation on desirable technological  futures.

  Keynote: 'AI and ML - Tools for tacklinggreat societal challenges'

  <details>
  	<summary>Click to read abstract</summary>
  The talk will start by providing an overview of some of the greatest  challenges that societies around the world are facing right now, as well as an overview of AI and ML approaches that have been suggested or used to tackle some of these challenges. The focus will then turn  specifically to the climate crisis challenge. Efforts to mitigate  climate change will require not only engineering solutions but also  social and political solutions that will allow for technological  solutions to be effective. Hence, social sciences are key to tackling  the climate crisis challenge. The advance of AI, ML and other  computational methods has recently transformed the social sciences,  creating a new field computational social science. Various examples will be reviewed during the talk where computational social science  approaches have been used to study social change in response to the  climate crisis. Mentioned will be also computational social science  studies, which for instance uncovered powerful networks that have been  undermining world’s climate mitigation efforts. Finally, we will discuss where computational social science can contribute to future social  science research on climate change, for instance going beyond describing social change by researching mechanisms and dynamics to steer  democratic climate-positive social change.

  <u>Keynote talk:</u> "AI and democracy: AI in politics and the politics of AI"

  <details>
  	<summary>Click to read abstract</summary>
  As artificial intelligence technology features in ever more aspects of social and economic life, AI becomes political. The use of AI by politicians and states is associated with both hopes and fears. Will AI increase social inequalities and allow politicians to split and manipulate the public? Or will AI allow politicians and states to tackle important problems with better information and new solutions? These fears and hopes find expression in public debate and political contestation. Scholars have an important role in this debate. They are on the frontlines of AI development and its implementation. At the same time, excessive fears or hopes regarding the impact of AI might make for great movie-plots but not so much for good policy advice or ethical guidelines. So, while we need to discuss the potential uses and effects of AI in democracies, we should not be carried away by excessive fears or hopes and thereby accidentally block progress or sow distrust in politics and elections.
